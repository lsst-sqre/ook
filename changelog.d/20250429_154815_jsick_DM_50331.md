### New features

- Added a new Author API to interact with author metadata records from Rubin Observatory's author database, which is canonically maintained as the `etc/authordb.yaml` file in [lsst/lsst-texmf](https://github.com/lsst/lsst-texmf).

  - Use the new endpoint `GET /ook/authors` to paginate over all author records. Author records include affiliations.

  - Use `GET /ook/authors/id/{internal_id}` to retrieve the record for a single author based on their author ID.

- Added a Glossary API to interact with the Rubin Observatory glossary, which is canonically maintained in the `etc/glossarydefs.csv` and `etc/glossarydefs_es.csv` files in [lsst/lsst-texmf](https://github.com/lsst/lsst-texmf).

  - The `GET /ook/glossary/search?q={term}` endpoint allows searching for glossary terms. The search is case-insensitive and typo-tolerant.

- A new ingest endpoint, `POST /ook/ingest/lsst-texmf` triggers a refresh of author and glossary data from the `lsst/lsst-texmf` repository.

### Other changes

- Fixed the process for creating Alembic migrations, ensuring that the previous database schema is mounted correctly.
- The FastStream lifecycle is no longer explicitly managed.
