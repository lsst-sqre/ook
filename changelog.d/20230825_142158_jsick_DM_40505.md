### New features

- The new `ook audit` command (and associated `AlgoliaAuditService`) audits the contents of the Algolia index to determine if all documents registered in the _LSST the Docs_ API are represented in the Algolia index. This command can be run as `ook audit --reingest` to automatically queue reingestion jobs for any missing documents.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the CLI entrypoint from `squarebot` to `ook`.

### Other changes

- The Factory is refactored. A `ProcessContext` now holds singleton clients for the duration of the process, and is used for both the API handlers and for worker processes, including CLI instantiations of Ook as Kubernetes jobs. This new architecture moves configuration of Kubernetes and registration of Kafka Avro schemas out of the main module and into the factory instantiation.
- The Algolia search client is now mocked for testing. This allows the new factory to always create a search client for the process context. It also means that Algolia client credentials are always required; the test configuration uses substitute keys for the mock.
