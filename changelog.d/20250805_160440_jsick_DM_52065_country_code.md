### Backwards-incompatible changes

- This version adds a new `address_country_code` column to the `affiliation` table. This requires an Alembic migration, `c03d146610d8` to `8e529b9177a0`.

### New features

- Ook now stores the two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code for an affiliation in the `affiliation` table, in addition to storing the country as provided by `authordb.yaml`. When a country code is available, it is used for determining the affiliation's country name, with a fallback to the country name column when absent. This should add reliability to affiliation address data.

- The new CLI command, `ook migrate-country-codes` migrates existing country names to the country codes column.
