### New features

- A new endpoint, `/ook/ingest/sdm-schemas` triggers an ingest of links for schema, table, and column entities in the https://github.com/lsst/sdm_schemas repository to targets in https://sdm-schemas.lsst.io. This endpoint is being developed towards the creation of a links API service, see [SQR-086](https://sqr-086.lsst.io).
