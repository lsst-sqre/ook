### Backwards-incompatible changes

- The app is rewritten as a FastAPI/Safir app, replacing its heritage as an aiohttp/Safir app. The app is also now deployed with Helm via [Phalanx](https://phalanx.lsst.io) Because of this, Ook should be considered as an entirely new app, with no backwards compatibility with the previous version.
- Ook no longer receives GitHub webhooks; the intent is to get GitHub webhook events from Squarebot (through Kafka) in the future.
- Ook no longer receives Kafka messages from LTD Events since that app isn't avabile in the new Roundtable deployment. A new ingest trigger is being developed in the interim. Until then, ingests can be manually triggered by the `POST /ook/ingest/ltd` endpoint.

### New features

- Ook is now a FastAPI/Safir app.
- Ook uses Pydantic models for its Kafka message schemas.
- Ook is now built around a service/domain/handler architecture, bringing it in line with SQuaRE's modern apps. The Kafka consumer is considered a handler.

### Other changes

- The change log is maintained with scriv
- Tests are now orchestrated through nox.
