### Other changes

- Migrated dependency management to UV lockfiles, with dependencies defined in pyproject.toml's `dependencies` array and `dependency-groups` table. In addition to deleting the old `requirements/` files, this change also affects the Dockerfile, GitHub Actions, and Nox setup (`noxfile.py`).

- Adopt Python 3.13.
