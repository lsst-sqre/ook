### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Changed the `GET /authors/id/{id}` endpoint to now be `GET /authors/{id}` to align with the other endpoints in the API.
- Change SQL table names to be singular instead of plural. This change requires a database migration (Alembic migration `fb5ed49d63d5`).

### New features

- The `POST /ingest/lsst-texmf` endpoint (and `ook ingest-lsst-texmf` command) provides an option to delete author records that are no longer present in `authordb.yaml`. This is not the default behavior.

### Bug fixes

- Collaborations are now filtered out from the `/authors` endpoint. We may add a new collaborations endpoint in the future.
- Terms in `glossarydefs.csv` are deduplicated before being added to the database. This prevents duplicate terms in the CSV, a common typo, from preventing the ingestion of the glossary definitions.
