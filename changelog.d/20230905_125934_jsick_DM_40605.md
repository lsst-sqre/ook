### Bug fixes

- Improved and logging and exception reporting around the `ook audit` command.
- Fixed the `base_url` attribute's JSON alias for the Algolia DocumentRecord model. Was `baseURL` and is now restored to `baseUrl`.
- Fix typo in creating records for Lander content types (`source_update_time` and `source_update_timestamp` fields).
