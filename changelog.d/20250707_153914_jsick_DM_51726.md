### Backwards-incompatible changes

- The author resources in the REST API have the following changes:

  - The `surname` field is now `family_name` to better match common usage.

  - The affiliation metadata is no longer a simple string, but instead a structured object with address components.

- A database migration is required.

### New features

- In addition to the backwards-incompatible changes related to the author `family_name` field and affiliation `address`, the authors API now includes the ROR ID for affiliations and the department name for an affiliation, where appropriate. Ook now reflects the structure of lsst/lsst-texmf's authordb.yaml file as of 2025-07-05.
