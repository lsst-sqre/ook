### New features

- New Links API, available at `/ook/links`, that provides documentation links to Observatory and survey entities across different domains. This Links API is described in [SQR-086](https://sqr-086.lsst.io). Initially the Links API supports links to documentation about the Science Domain Model (SDM) schemas, tables, and columns.
- New ingest endpoint, `POST /ook/ingest/sdm-schemas`, for consuming the SDM schema YAML files from the [lsst/sdm_schemas](https://github.com/lsst/sdm_schemas). This ingest API persists the SDM schemas into Ook's Postgres database, and also creates links to the schema browser at sdm-schemas.lsst.io for the Links API.

### Other changes

- Ook now uses a Postgres database to maintain datasets. Initially Postgres tables are used to store the SDM schemas as well as links for the Links API. The Postgres database is managed by Alembic, and the database schema is maintained with SQLAlchemy.
- The nox `run` session can now run with roundtable-dev credentials from 1Password for testing the application locally. See `square.env` for details.
