### Backwards-incompatible changes

- A database migration is required to add a new `search_vector` column to the `author` table. This column enables full-text search capabilities and is populated with computed values from the `given_name` and `surname` fields. Requires Alembic migration from `1ad667eab84e` to `c03d146610d8`.

### New features

- The `/authors` endpoint now supports a `search` query parameter that allows for flexible and typo-tolerant searching of authors by name. The search system automatically detects and handles various name formats:

  - "Last, First"
  - "Last, Initial"
  - "First Last"
  - Family name only
  - Given name only
  - Compound family names
  - Names with suffixes
  - Partial names, initials, and typos

### Other changes

- Improved codebase compatibility with coding agents like Claude:

  - Streamlined the logging output from `nox` tests to reduce noise.
  - Added Claude context file (`CLAUDE.md`) with project instructions.
