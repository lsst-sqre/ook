LSST has Labview, C++, Python and Java components - these are built in different ways and do not employ the same test harnesses. We are attempting to align all build/testing on Jenkins, although this is challenging for LabView for example. In Data Management all testing is done via pytest, all C++ code is exposed to Python so we may test it all in the python layer. Since we have a common access layer to all Telescope control components (OpenSplice) we could follow the same approach there. Next we are approaching deployment on the summit. To date deployments in telescope control have been fairly manual. As we shifted more toward Python, containers became more prevalent. Now most components can be deployed with Docker and Docker compose. The next logical step for them is to move to Kubernetes; this may not be possible for the camera control system but we will try to pursue this as much as possible. Data Management is already deploying the Science Platform using Kubernetes. Though the processing software for data releases is containerised it is not yet utilized in that manner. Finally the bare metal provisioning is not fully automated - we have successfully experimented with Foreman and Puppet to bring up new blades in a selected manner. Our approach here is to provision to Kubernetes as much as possible but for other specific machines, such as camera control, to at least provision the machine with Puppet to the level needed by the camera control system. There are strong management/cultural issues in bringing these efforts together. These are prevalent in all large projects and some of these issues will be touched on in the talk also.\n\nData Management\n\nLSST data management system and the data products are described in:\n\n-   The LSST Data Management System:\n\n-   Data Products Definition Document:\n\nCamera\n\n-   Design and development of the LSST camera:\n\nTelescope and Site\n\n-   Telescope and site overview and status in 2014:\n\nSystem Engineering\n\n-   LSST systems engineering:\n\n-   System verification and validation:\n\nINITIAL PAPER LIST ADDED HERE FOR REFERENCE.\n\n\u201cEditor\u201d is a responsible team leader but not necessarily the person who will do most of the required work, or who will eventually become the first author. Both issues will be handled by individual teams.\n\n\n    domain: Telescope & Site\n    editor: Jeff Barr\n    title: Overview of the LSST Telescope\n\n    domain: Telescope & Site\n    editor: Sandrine Thomas\n    title: Performance of the LSST Telescope\n\n    domain: Telescope & Site\n    editor: Lynne Jones\n    title: The LSST Scheduler Overview and Performance\n\n    domain: Telescope & Site\n    editor: Bo Xin\n    title: Performance of the LSST Active Optics System\n\n    domain: Telescope & Site\n    editor: Tiago Ribeiro\n    title: LSST Observing System Software Architecture\n\n    domain: Camera\n    editor: Justin Wolfe\n    title: LSST Camera Optics\n\n    domain: Camera\n    editor: Chris Stubbs\n    title: LSST Camera Rafts\n\n    domain: Camera\n    editor: Steve Ritz\n    title: LSST Camera Cryostat\n\n    domain: Camera\n    editor: Ralph Schindler\n    title: LSST Camera Refrigeration\n\n    domain: Camera\n    editor: Steve Ritz\n    title: LSST Camera Body and Mechanisms\n\n    domain: Camera\n    editor: Mark Huffer and Tony Johnson\n    title: LSST Camera Control System and DAQ\n\n    domain: Camera\n    editor: Tim Bond and Aaron Rodman\n    title: LSST Camera Integration and Tests\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Leanne Guy\n    title: Overview of LSST Data Management\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Michelle Butler\n    title: LSST Data Facility\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Tim Jenness\n    title: LSST Data Management Software System\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Jim Bosch\n    title: LSST Data Release Processing\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Eric Bellm\n    title: LSST Prompt Data Products\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Gregory Dubois-Felsmann\n    title: LSST Science Platform\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Simon Krughoff\n    title: LSST Data Management Quality Assurance and Reliability Engineering\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Leanne Guy (with likely delegation to new DM V&V Scientist)\n    title: LSST Data Management System Verification and Validation\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Mario Juric\n    title: LSST Moving Object Processing\n\n    domain: Data Management\n    editor: Robert Lupton\n    title: LSST Calibration Strategy and Pipelines\n\n    domain: Calibration\n    editor: Patrick Ingraham\n    title:  Performance of the LSST Calibration Systems\n\n    domain: Calibration\n    editor: Patrick Ingraham\n    title: Atmospheric Properties with the LSST Auxiliary Telescope\n\n    domain: EPO\n    editor: Amanda Bauer\n    title: Overview of LSST Education and Public Outreach\n\n    domain: EPO\n    editor: Ardis Herrold\n    title: LSST Formal Education Program\n\n    domain: EPO\n    editor: Amanda Bauer\n    title: LSST EPO: The User Feedback\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Chuck Claver\n    title: LSST Observatory System Operations Readiness Report\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Bo Xin\n    title: Performance of Delivered LSST System\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Chuck Claver\n    title: Active Optics Performance with LSST Commissiong Camera\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Chuck Claver\n    title: LSST Active Optics Performance with the LSST Science Camera\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Brian Stalder\n    title: Integration, Test and Commissioning Results from LSST Commissiong Camera\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Kevin Reil\n    title: LSST Camera Instrumental Signature Characterization, Calibration and Removal\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Patrick Hascal\n    title: Installation and Performance of the LSST Camera Refrigeration System\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Andy Connolly\n    title: Science Validation of LSST Alert Processing\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Keith Bechtol\n    title: Science Validation of LSST Data Release Processing\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Michael Reuter\n    title: Tracking of LSST System Performance with Continuous Integration Methods\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Chuck Claver\n    title: The LSST Science Platform as a Commissioning Tool\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Chuck Claver\n    title: Commissioning Science Data Quality Analysis Tools, Methods and Procedures\n\n    domain: Commissioning\n    editor: Lynne Jones\n    title: Performance Verification of the LSST Survey Scheduler\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\nACRONYMS\n\n\n  ACRONYM   DESCRIPTION\n  --------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  DAQ       Data Acquisition System\n  DM        Data Management\n  EPO       Education and Public Outreach\n  LSE       LSST Systems Engineering (Document Handle)\n  LSST      Legacy Survey of Space and Time (formerly Large Synoptic Survey Telescope)\n\n\n",
