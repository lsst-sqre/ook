The official scope options which one might invoke are listed in , but we have also identified some further possibilities which are described in this document. This note also discusses the practical aspects of invoking these options.\n\nWe have identified three viable cost saving options in 2018, of which two are not in the currently baselined version of :\n\n-   Eliminate portal aspect of science platform (DM-10; refer to Section\u00a0[sect:dm10]).\n\n-   Reduce quality of data facility services provided to the construction project (DM15; refer to Section\u00a0[sect:dm15]).\n\n-   Move staff from institutions to AURA posts (DM16; refer to Section\u00a0[sect:dm16]).\n\nIn addition there are other tasks which may be delayed, thus keeping them available as options which may be invoked later. These are:\n\n-   Delay base center operation in Chile (keeps DM13 available, and saves money on operational costs).\n\n-   Delay development of the mini broker.\n\n-   Return some budget from DAX.\n\nAll of this will be rolled up in one or more LCRs in the not too distant future.\n\n\n\nDM10: SCIENCE PLATFORM PORTAL\n\n\nA detailed run through specific requirements for the portal is given in Appendix\u00a0[sect:reqs]. Many of the front end requirements are currently met and others may be questioned, however invoking this option introduces some risk that science may be lost. We should be clear that effectively removing one of our development groups is disruptive to the DM project, especially after a review which approved the new budget and schedule which we have been following well.\n\nConcretely we would reduce the effort expenditure on the Portal and Firefly from IPAC to about 0.2 FTE over a period of four to five months. We would continue the IPAC support for DM Architecture and the Science Platform Scientist.\n\nIf we follow DM10 to the letter, we would eliminate the Portal and this would mean a reduction in support of the broad science community, especially novice and casual users. Hence we would rather keep the portal in its current incarnation, pause development, and then restart closer to the initial need date for a portal (DR1). At this point, we would take the opportunity to evaluate the then-available technology for the Portal.\n\nThe LSST EPO subsystem also needs a portal (Section\u00a0[sect:epo]) and has already decided that Firefly is not a suitable technology. A consideration of possible alternatives is already underway. Within the AURA family, STScI and NOAO have portals. We have concerns about their capabilities and usability and believe that the current version of the LSST Portal is more advanced and suited to science goals of LSST, but perhaps those could be addressed with appropriate directives from AURA and synergy with LSST.\n\nThe existing system is adequate for the analysis of commissioning data. We would therefore target the availability of DR1 for the launch of an updated portal. The other area of potential concern is the front end for the alert subscription in the mini broker. This should be a thin veneer on the mini broker API and is also not needed until start of operations.\n\nGiven the above we would reserve $1M for the later development of an updated portal for DR1 We would not go to zero immediately to allow IPAC to adjust accordingly. Plus we would keep some level of effort \u2014 say, 0.2 FTE \u2014 for bug fixes on the existing portal. An LCR will provided detailed costings, but initial estimates are that this will save at least $2M. We believe the final impact on science is minimal.\n\n\nEPO Skyviewer\n\nThe EPO equivalent of the DM Portal is called the Skyviewer. All EPO requirements including Skyviewer, are listed in which will be updated in the coming months. A few relevant requirements, particularly for Skyviewer, are listed below as well as more descriptive text based on the results of our market research, conducted during 2017 and early 2018.\n\nThe current EPO Skyviewer Design is on confluence  https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/x/kYGuBQ.\n\nThe Skyviewer is intended for a general, non-specialist audience. Providing context for the data displayed through the Skyviewer enables meaningful and engaging user experiences and is part of the mission of EPO. The Skyviewer will display color images of the LSST sky and allow users to pan and zoom, and access additional information for individual objects. The Skyviewer will allow for guided or freeform exploration and will connect users to other features of the website that encourage deeper engagement, like citizen science projects, articles, or interactive notebooks (either html or Jupyter).\n\nRequirements on Skyviewer\n\n-   EPO-REQ-0191: The Skyviewer image tiles shall be in color.\n\n-   EPO-REQ-0192: The Skyviewer will be mobile-friendly.\n    _This is an important distinction between the DM Portal and the EPO Skyviewer._ DM users will be happy with this but of course it may limit some functionality on the full screen version.\n\n-   EPO-REQ-0193-197 are about navigation - pan and zoom with keyboard, touchpad, mouse\n\n-   EPO-REQ-0197-198 Can select single object. Selection of single object presents _Object Page_ with more info (EPO-REQ-0199) such as:\n\n    -   an object ID (EPO-REQ-0200),\n\n    -   coordinates (EPO-REQ-0131),\n\n    -   small image cutout (EPO-REQ-0201),\n\n    -   an animated sequence of images if they exist (EPO-REQ-0159),\n\n    -   alert stream data, if they exist (EPO-REQ-0202),\n\n    -   light curve data, if they exist (EPO-REQ-0203),\n\n    -   link to other VO info ( EPO-REQ-0204, EPO-REQ-0205)\n\n    -   definitions for unfamiliar terms\n\n-   EPO-REQ-0156: EPO will present to users a list of curated objects to explore.\n\n    -   Listicles like \u201c10 Beautiful Galaxies\u201d or \u201cNear Earth Objects\u201d appeal to a non-scientist audience and provide context around the common \u201cwhat now?\u201d question.\n\n    -   EPO audiences are interested in search capabilities but will not know coordinates or specifics for queries. Instead, they will want a familiar \u201cgoogle-like\u201d search bar to find the \u201cfaintest star seen\u201d or \u201cmost distant galaxy\u201d, for example.\n\n    -   Automatically highlighting interesting objects that are in the view of the user at any given time by circling them, displaying thumbnail images of these objects in a side panel, and providing further information (i.e. object pages with light curves, comparisons to similar objects). This type of UI design is more similar to World Wide Telescope than other existing options EPO has so far investigated (more on this below).\n\n    -   many of these features may require back end work similar to DMS-PRTL-REQ-0009 to 38, Async Queries, Spatial, Id etc.\n\nAll of these are compatible with the DM requirements, relevant DM requirements are in Appendix\u00a0[sect:reqs].\n\n Requirements related to Alerts\n\n-   EPO-REQ-0157: Graphic overlay of the Alert Stream wall be presented\n\n-   EPO-REQ-0158: Filtering options will allow users to select different alert data criteria to adjust their graphic overlay\n\nThis functionality was not required in DM - we do have requirements for alert filter selection not covered in EPO.\n\nOther considerations\n\nEmbedding the Skyviewer inside other web pages such as articles or as a supplement to press releases is a nice-to-have feature not currently described in the requirements.\n\nThere are currently no EPO requirements related to transferring between the Skyviewer and notebooks, or even selecting more than a single object (ie. nothing similar to DMS-LSP-REQ-0010: Transfer between portal and notebook.)\n\nExisting Technologies\n\nEPO has investigated existing technologies that could power the Skyviewer, including Aladdin lite, World Wide Telescope (WWT), and Google Sky. While WWT aligns most closely with the user interface design, no commitment has been made and EPO intends to revisit the topic when development is scheduled to begin in FY20 (this timing will be reflected in the upcoming EPO baseline update, planned to be in place by Feb 2019). We believe DM should be involved in this process to see how much we can work together to a single portal even if that is deployed in multiple locations with different data sets. .\n\n\n\nDM15: REDUCE INSTITUTIONAL OVERHEADS\n\n\nIf we could identify perhaps ten individuals who would move to AURA posts, thus eliminating institutional overheads, we could save potentially $100k per individual or $1M per year. It will take months to put this in place of course so we would not get three years of savings. The institutes may complain but we expect this to be minimal. This is a scientifically and functionally painless way to trim the budget, but may cause some disruption for the individuals concerned in the short term.\n\nPotential saving of $2M or more to end of construction.\n\n\n\nDM16: REDUCE LDF SERVICE LEVEL\n\n\nNCSA has been asked to do an impact analysis of a reduction in budget by 20%. This can only be achieved by reducing the staffing level from 20 FTE to 16. This may result in a lower service level for DM development but it probably has no impact on science, except in the realm of reliability. We are awaiting the analysis from NCSA.\n\nAdopting a \u201ccloud computing\u201d based approach may yield further savings. We are currently prototyping cloud-based deployments of DM systems in conjunction with Google. Assessing the actual cost of this relative to physical hardware at NCSA is difficult; see for a rough comparison.\n\nA 20% reduction in NCSA costs for the remaining four years of construction is worth about $3.5M.\n\n\n\nREFERENCES[SECT:REFS]\n\n\n\nACRONYMS [SECT:ACRONYMS]\n\n\nThe following is a complete list of acronyms used in this document.\n\n  ACRONYM   DESCRIPTION\n  --------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  AP        Alerts Production\n  API       Application Programming Interface\n  AURA      Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy\n  DAX       Data access services\n  DM        Data Management\n  DMS       Data Management Sub-system\n  DMTN      DM Technical Note\n  EPO       Education and Public Outreach\n  FTE       Full-Time Equivalent\n  ID        Identifier\n  IPAC      No longer an acronym\n  LCR       LSST Change Request\n  LDF       LSST Data Facility\n  LDM       Light Data Management\n  LPM       LSST Project Management (Document Handle)\n  LSE       LSST Systems Engineering (Document Handle)\n  LSP       Low System Priority\n  LSST      Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n  NCSA      National Center for Supercomputing Applications\n  NOAO      National Optical Astronomy Observatories (USA)\n  SUI       Science User Interface\n  UI        User Interface\n  VO        Virtual Observatory\n  WWT       World Wide Telescope\n\n\n\n OVERVIEW OF REQUIREMENTS AFFECTED BY DM-10\n\n\nenumerates the Science Platform requirements. The labels used here are from that document and are the requirements affected by the scope option. is a test report on the Science Platform.\n\nNOTE: The commissioning needs for SUI/Firefly are mostly satisfied in the current version of Firefly. Remaining essential functionality will be addressed in the rampdown period.\n\n-   DMS-LSP-REQ-0008, DMS-PRTL-REQ-0004 Semantic linkage - logical links between data shown in portal\n\n    -   Have an implementation this but it is going to have to evolve with the data model.\n\n    -   More work for science users if we do not expend further effort on it\n\n-   DMS-LSP-REQ-0010 Transfer between portal and notebook\n\n    -   We have a current implementation of this - it could be improved but is sufficient for commissioning needs.\n\n-   User Storage - implication of UI for DMS-LSP-REQ-0011 to 18\n\n    -   some of this is done.\n\n    -   the actual storage implementation is in DAX.
