"""Tests for the bounded per-test database truncate.

These run against the dedicated DDL database so the deliberately blocking
transaction can never contend with the session-scoped application. The tests
that need a specific driver error inject a canned one through
`_TruncateFailingEngine` rather than racing PostgreSQL for it, but they still
run the real retry loop against a real database so the blocker diagnostics are
exercised too.
